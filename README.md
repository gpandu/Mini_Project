# Mini_Project
To determine appropriate threshold value from simple image statistics using RATS algorithm.

1.Objective is to obtain segmented image and its comparison with Ground truth image using simple image statistics.
2.Gabor response images and corresponding ground truth images are provided in input images folder. The images are in .bmp format
   path to Gabor response images--->  input images folder\Gabor response
   path to Ground truth images--->  input images folder\Ground truth

3.Enter names of set of images and their ground truth images on executing the program.
(Enter atleast 2 pair of images)
4.Threshold,Accuracy and other comparison measures with respect to Ground image will be displayed on Command prompt.
5.Moving trackbar, measures for different images can be obtained.
